# Diagnostic Findings

## EvD Position Swap — 2026-04-18

**Question:** Is EvD's 5-0 Elf decisive record a P1 position advantage, faction eval asymmetry, or sample variance?

**Method:** Ran 10 games with Demon as P1, Elf as P2 (same limits: timeBudget=200ms, MAX_TURNS=35, MAX_ACTIONS=600).

**Results:**

| Config | P1 wins | P2 wins | Draws | DR | Action-limit hits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elf(P1) vs Demon(P2) | 5 (Elf) | 0 (Demon) | 5 | 50% | 3/10 |
| Demon(P1) vs Elf(P2) | 0 (Demon) | 3 (Elf) | 7 | 70% | 7/10 |
| Combined | — | — | 12 | 60% | 10/20 |

**Interpretation:** Faction eval asymmetry favoring Elf (Mystic). Elf won 3+ from P2 position, meeting CEO's asymmetry threshold. Demon wins 0 decisive games in either position.

**Secondary finding:** Action-limit hit rate nearly doubled when Demon plays P1 (7/10 vs 3/10). Demon games stall without resolution — possible Dark faction stagnation/looping behavior in AI.

**Status:** Reported to CEO. Awaiting direction on whether to investigate Mystic eval terms or address Dark stagnation separately.

**Proposed next step:** Instrument boardEval.js to log top-N term contributions per decision (Elf vs Demon) across a short game sample to isolate which eval terms systematically favor Mystic.

## Per-Term Eval Contribution Diagnostic — 2026-04-18

**Question:** Which eval terms produce the observed Mystic advantage over Dark? Is it (a) terms that inherently favor Mystic strategies, (b) faction-specific weight imbalances, or (c) Dark-specific cards being undervalued by the eval?

**Method:** Instrumented `boardEval.js` to sample every 100th evaluation. Logged faction, turn, totalScore, and per-term contributions (raw value × weight). Ran 10 EvD games (5 Elf-P1, 5 Demon-P1). JSONL: `memory/eval-contributions-2026-04-18.jsonl`.

**Configuration:** timeBudget=200ms, MAX_TURNS=35, MAX_ACTIONS=600 (old limit: game 10 hit 500-action limit — legacy code path). Branch: `diag/eval-term-contributions`. Instrumentation reverted. Commit: e5b457b.

**Sample counts:** 1130 total — Mystic: 800, Dark: 330. 2.4× sample imbalance favoring Mystic (Elf has more legal actions per turn → wider minimax tree → more eval calls hit sample threshold).

**NOTE on game outcomes:** Diagnostic run showed 100% DR. This is an artifact — synchronous `appendFileSync` in the eval hot path degraded AI decision quality significantly. Do not use game outcomes from this run for balance analysis. The eval contribution data itself is valid.

### Top 5 Terms Per Faction

**Mystic (Elf):** championProximity 96.54 (18.9%), championHP 93.63 (21.7%), lethalThreat 73.67 (10.8%), championHPDiff 53.31 (10.8%), allyCardValue 44.57 (10.1%)

**Dark (Demon):** lethalThreat 100.19 (18.3%), championProximity 91.80 (41.2%), championHP 71.94 (41.5%), projectedChampionDamage 52.42 (9.9%), cardsInHand 50.23 (41.6%)

### Interpretation

**Answer to hypothesis (a) — Terms that inherently favor Mystic strategies:** YES. `tradeEfficiency` (4.76×), `unitCountDiff` (5.79×), `boardCentrality` (9.19×), `throneControl` (16.82×) all systematically favor Mystic. Elf's units control the board, win trades, and occupy the throne/center. These are structural advantages from Elf cards, not eval weighting.

**Answer to hypothesis (b) — Faction-specific weight imbalances:** PARTIAL. Mystic gets `throneControlValue: 30` vs Dark base 25. The `throneControlValue` ratio is 1.36× (not extreme). The weight override provides some advantage but is not the dominant driver.

**Answer to hypothesis (c) — Dark cards undervalued:** NO (reversed finding). Dark's cards ARE being valued — `hiddenUnits` contributes 13.23 avg and `cardsInHand` contributes 50.23 (41.6% of Dark's total score!). Dark has card and stealth advantages the eval is recognizing. However, Dark cannot convert these advantages to board control (boardCentrality and unitCountDiff are negative for Dark).

**Primary cause of Mystic advantage:**
1. **`championHPDiff` (+53 Mystic vs −38 Dark):** Elf's healing cards (bloom, overgrowth, ancientspring, etc.) systematically keep Elf's champion at higher HP than Demon's. This is a **real game-state asymmetry caused by healing cards**, not an eval bug.
2. **Board control (unitCountDiff, boardCentrality, throneControl):** Elf consistently has more units, controls the center, and holds the throne. Demon's card advantage (cardsInHand 50.23) is not being translated to board presence.
3. **tradeEfficiency (4.76×):** Elf's units outperform Demon's units in head-to-head combat.

**Secondary balance flag:**  
`cardsInHand = 10` weight (changed from 5, now verified on main). At weight 10, cardsInHand represents 41.6% of Dark's total score. This may be making Dark too passive — the eval rewards holding cards, discouraging commitment. This is a **potential balance flag**, not an AI issue.

**Status:** Reported to CEO. Awaiting direction.
